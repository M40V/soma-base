This module is useful whenever you need to be sure that a function (more
exactly anything that can be called by python) is executed in a particular
thread.

For exemple, if you use PyMat (which is an interface between Python and a Matlab,
see U{http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~steriana/Python} for more information)
it is necessary that all calls to pymat.eval are done by the same thread that
called pymat.open. If you want to use PyMat in a multi-threaded application,
you will have to build appropriate calling mechanism as the one proposed in
this module.

The main idea is to use a list containing functions to be called with their
parameters. A single thread is used to get entries from the list and execute
the corresponding functions. Any thread can put a call request on the list
either asynchonously (the requesting thread continues to run without waiting
for the call to be done) or synchronously (the requesting thread is stopped
until the call is done and the result available).

import threading
import time


class SingleThreadCalls:

    '''
    Allows the registration of functions that are going to be called from a
    single thread. This single thread must continuously call
    :meth:`processFunctions`.

    Registration can be blocking (see :meth:`call`) or non blocking (see
    :meth:`push`).

    Blocking registration waits for the function to be processed and returns
    its result (or raises its exception). Non blocking registration puts the
    function in the list and returns immediately, ignoring any return value or
    exception.

    Example::

        stc = SingleThreadCall()
        processingThread = threading.Thread(target=stc.processingLoop)
        stc.setProcessingThread(processingThread)
        processingThread.start()
    '''

    def __init__(self, thread=None):
        '''
        The thread passed in parameter is the processing thread of this
        SingleThreadCalls. When started (which is not been done by
        :class:`SingleThreadCall`) it must continuously call
        :meth:`processFunctions` to execute the functions that have been
        registered with :meth:`call` and :meth:`push`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        thread: :class:`threading.Thread` instance or *None*
            Processing thread. If *None*, :func:`threading.currentThread`
            is used.

    def setProcessingThread(self, thread):
        '''
        Defines the thread that processes the functions. The behaviour of
        :meth:`call` and :meth:`push` is different if called from the
        processing thread or from another one.

        Parameters
        ----------
        thread: :class:`threading.Thread`
            Processing thread

    def call(self, function, *args, **kwargs):
        '''
        Registers a function call and waits for the processing thread to call
        it.

        Returns the result of the function. If an exception is raised during
        the execution of the function, this exception is also raised by
        :meth:`call`.
        Therefore :meth:`call` behaves like a direct call to the function.

        It is possible to use :meth:`call` from the processing thread. In this
        case, no registration is done (the function is executed immedialey).

        Parameters
        ----------
        function: callable

        args:
